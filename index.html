        Hello! I'm <strong>Akshaj Nadimpalli</strong>, a passionate high school student fascinated 
        by the <em>interdisciplinary applications of machine learning</em> and the 
        <em>intersection of mathematics and ML</em>. My academic interests include applying 
        advanced computational techniques to solve real-world problems in fields ranging from 
        data science to robotics and beyond. I enjoy exploring new algorithms, optimizing 
        existing approaches, and discovering ways to bridge theoretical foundations with 
        practical deployments.

        Beyond my research, I love exploring cutting-edge technologies, developing creative 
        solutions for everyday challenges, and collaborating with like-minded individuals 
        on <em>innovative, impact-driven projects</em>. In my free time, I indulge in
        reading about computational math breakthroughs, tinkering with open-source code,

    <!-- SWARM INTELLIGENCE RESEARCH -->
    <div class="project">
      <h3>Swarm Intelligence Research</h3>
      <p>
        In this project, I investigated the use of agent-based models to enhance 
        collective decision-making and resource allocation in multi-agent systems. 
        Building on the concept of <em>swarm robotics</em>, I integrated Dihedral 
        and Cyclic group theory approaches into an **evolutionary algorithm** to 
        discover optimal coordination strategies. These strategies improved 
        collision avoidance, task distribution, and formation control across 
        numerous simulations (like the Halite Challenge), demonstrating that 
        symmetry-based approaches can significantly boost performance in 
        real-world robotics and complex systems. The research culminated in 
        a paper showcasing how algebraic analysis and geometric optimization 
        can shape more robust, scalable, and energy-efficient swarms.

    <!-- STARTUP SUCCESS PREDICTION MODEL -->
    <div class="project">
      <h3>Startup Success Prediction Model</h3>
      <p>
        This comprehensive study analyzed **4,000+ startup cases** to understand 
        which factors drive entrepreneurial success. I compiled a robust dataset 
        encompassing variables such as industry sector, company age, prior 
        founder experience, educational background, and geographic region. 
        Leveraging advanced machine learning (Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, 
        Logistic Regression), I identified the key predictors—like <em>Years 
        Since Founded</em> and <em>Number of Founded Organizations</em>—that 
        have the highest impact on a startup’s success rate. Beyond mere 
        classification accuracy (up to 82%), I used feature importance 
        analysis to give entrepreneurs and investors data-driven strategies 
        for navigating today’s competitive startup environment. The study 
        also employed logistic regression to predict probabilities of success, 
        providing actionable insights that founders can use when seeking 
        funding or making operational decisions.

    <!-- VERDANT (GARDEN APP) -->
    <div class="project">
      <h3>Verdant - Prouce for All</h3>
      <p>
        Verdant connects community gardens to shelters in need, helping them plan, plant, and harvest produce efficiently. Shelters can submit requests through the platform, which uses machine learning to determine a planting schedule that we as volunteers can follow to provide as much as possible. I built Verdant around a neural network architecture designed to forecast planting schedules and expected produce yields. Specifically, I fine-tuned a pretrained LSTM-based model (originally from Keras/TensorFlow’s time-series forecasting repository) using historical weather data (e.g., from local NOAA data feeds), soil-condition metrics, and past yield logs collected from regional community gardens. The neural network’s core layers comprise several LSTM blocks for sequence modeling and a final dense layer to output precise harvest predictions. This training process enabled Verdant to factor in weather fluctuations, seasonal soil dynamics, and historical donation patterns. By integrating these data-driven forecasts into a user-friendly web interface, the app empowers local gardeners to plan crop rotations more accurately, minimize waste, and optimize produce donations to nearby food banks.

    <!-- 911 CALL ANALYSIS MODEL -->
    <div class="project">
      <h3>911 Call Analysis Model</h3>
      <p>
        This Flask-based application leverages **association rule mining** 
        (Apriori) on 911 call data to unearth hidden patterns and frequent 
        itemsets regarding call reasons (EMS, Fire, Traffic) and other 
        attributes. I engineered an end-to-end pipeline where data is 
        ingested, cleaned, and transformed into a one-hot encoded format, 
        then processed by the Apriori algorithm to derive data-driven 
        insights. These insights can guide emergency response teams 
        on how to allocate resources more effectively. The app features 
        a sleek web interface for real-time exploration, letting users 
        quickly see top rules and filter calls by reason.

    <!-- OPENCV SHAPE/OBJECT RECOGNITION -->
    <div class="project">
      <h3>OpenCV Shape/Object Recognition Model</h3>
      <p>
        This project showcases my exploration of **computer vision** via 
        OpenCV. The model accepts user-uploaded images and classifies 
        them into distinct categories—such as geometric shapes or 
        handwritten digits—using a pipeline of grayscale conversion, 
        resizing, feature extraction, and a machine learning classifier 
        (e.g., logistic regression or SVM). I built an interactive Flask 
        frontend to illustrate real-time image inference, highlighting 
        the immediate feedback loop essential in vision-based applications 
        like robotics, OCR, or user interface accessibility. This project 
        demonstrates how classical CV techniques can still achieve high 
        accuracy while being lightweight and easily deployable.

    <!-- CT SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING FAIR (CSEF) PROJECT -->
    <div class="project">
      <h3>CT Science and Engineering Fair: Optimizing Magnetic Fusion Reactors</h3>
      <p>
        For the Connecticut Science and Engineering Fair (CSEF), I developed 
        a theoretical optimization tool, dubbed “TOAST” (Theoretical 
        Optimization Algorithm for Sustainable Technology), that models 
        **Magneto-Inertial Fusion** configurations. Drawing upon the 
        Grad-Shafranov equation, I introduced a customizable pressure 
        function J(ψ) = α·ψ - β·ψ² + sin(ψ) + 0.1·cos(ψ) to capture 
        nuanced plasma behavior inside a Field Reversed Configuration (FRC). 
        By varying α (linear pressure gradient), β (ratio of plasma to magnetic 
        pressure), and the FRC radius, I simulated how changes in magnetic 
        flux profiles affect plasma temperature and density under the 
        **Lawson Criterion**. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Through a combination of penalty-based optimization and advanced 
        numerical methods (including `solve_bvp` in Python), I discovered 
        a sweet spot (α ≈ 102.4, β ≈ 22.9, radius ≈ 13.6 m) that balances 
        temperature (reaching ~125 million Kelvin) and density without 
        exceeding engineering limits (150 million Kelvin, 10<sup>22</sup> 
        particles/m³). The tool also explored the interplay of additional 
        factors like electrical current and pulse duration, highlighting 
        how these can be tuned to maximize net energy yield. This project 
        offers a conceptual framework for future fusion research and 
        underlines the potential of computational modeling in accelerating 
        clean energy innovations.
